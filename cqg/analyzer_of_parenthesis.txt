Analyzer of parenthesis.
It is necessary to develop program module that analyzes sequence of characters and finds out its state in terms of closed parenthesis.
You have to identify all possible cases and design the module providing a user all necessary info you think essential to describe each concrete state.
Additional requirements:
1) All non-parenthesis characters in the sequence have no impact on the parenthesis state.
2) The module shall be able to indicate current state of the sequence at arbitrary point.
3) There is no limitation on length of the sequence (it might be tested with huge amount of data).

To test the module the following simple Linux application has to be implemented:
1) The app shall read out lines from standard input stream. Each line shall be
handled as separate sequence of characters.
2) The app shall report state of each line to standard output.
5) The app shall report state of last sequence to output and exit if EOF is detected or some reading failure occurred.
6) Exit code of the app shall identify the reason of exit.

Additional Implementation Notes
1. You should use std C++ (program will be compiled and tested in Linux OS).
2. It is nice to design application in object oriented manner.
3. It is nice to comment classes, methods, data members, etc in English (Doxygen notation is preferable).
